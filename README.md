# Bucket List 

## Overview
This is the back-end for Note It, my capstone full-stack project for GA's web wedevelopment immersive. This is a single page application that allows people to sign up and write down there ideas on notecards on a virtual board. Users can create, update, delete, and view their notes. I began this project by creating the back end, and then linked the front end to the API that I had created.
